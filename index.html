        <h2>History of Enchiladas</h2>
        <p><u>Enchiladas</u> are a common traditional food from the country of Mexico. Enchiladas originate back to the <b><u>Mayans.</u></b> Corn was a very abundant and popular crop at the time with corn tortillas as common as corn. Originally, tortillas were called <b>Tlaxcalli</b>, but when Spanish conquistadors arrived, they renamed it to the now known tortillas. One day the Mayans rolled fish with tortillas and due to this, they brought and made the first kind of enchiladas which would also be adopted by Aztecs. Overtime, enchiladas became the stuffed tortillas with various meats and cheeses and different sauces to become the enchiladas we know today.</p>

        <p>Eighth grade was a pretty big stepping stone in my life. I went through all kinds of emotions such as happiness, pride, greed, sadness, anger, astonishment but moving on, I've had good times since. In the summer I mostly stayed in my house playing games with my friends but for some reason, this summer I didn't talk to my friends as much. I began to prioritize my time with my cousin, Jack, and my time with my niece, Lisa. At the start of July, Jack took me out to practice shooting with a soccer ball, and although I wasn't good, I still enjoyed it. He also took me to the gym every once in a while and I had been wanting to go for the longest of times so I was pretty thankful. Lisa wanted to play games with my and exposed me to one of my favorite games/visual novels that I've ever seen, Danganronpa. I've gotten very attatched to it all because of her, and we also played Pokemon Go a lot more. I really enjoyed this summer</p>
